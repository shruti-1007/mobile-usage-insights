# Project Insights

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using median imputation.
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Average battery drain: 15%.
- Strong correlation between app usage and battery drain (r = 0.75).

## Step 3: Battery Drain Analysis
- Regression model achieved R-squared of 0.85.
- Users with >50 apps experience higher battery drain (p < 0.01).
